# New Project Template

## Purpose

This is an example python project structure streamlined for data science use cases.

## Components

There are three key components to this project structure:

1. **data**
    * Files for analysis - small enough to be locally saved to Github
2. **src**
    * .py files containing important/utility functions
3. **notebooks**
    * .ipynb files which import data + src functions to visualize exploratory analysis
